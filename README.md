### Notes:

This was a fun project that really put my rails skills to the test.  I didn't really encounter any major problems.  I took my time and worked through it all and am really pleased with the end result.  

In my Facebook(Fakebook), users are able to do many of the same things as the real facebook.  Users can send friend requests, accept friend request, make posts, like posts, comment on posts, etc.

There are 5 default users that can be added.  They will accept friend requests sent to them automatically.  Once they are friends, a user can see all their posts and comments. 

### Built using:

Ruby on Rails - Web frameword
Devise - Authentication
Omniauth-facebook - Authentication
Bootstrap - CSS framework
Heroku - Cloud platform/server
SendGrid - Email service
